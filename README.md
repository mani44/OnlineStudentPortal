# V-MEET

In this project,we have developed a platform in the form of a web application to achieve
communication between the students to share messages and files. We have successfully
developed the modules including private and public chats as well as private and public file
sharing besides a common page for uploading important notices and information. 

With the development of this software, we hope to establish a common platform for all the
students to share files and messages and to construct a strong network to achieve
instantaneous requirements of the students in order to aid them academically and in other
aspects.
